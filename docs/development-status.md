# Development status
This module is still very early stages. We have tried our best to make it as stable as possible but its likely a lot of
things are still to be found.

###Current situation

So far, the testing has been conduct exclusively on Apache Solr and although we are using the Search API to perform the 
queries, any additional input, bugs etc is more than welcome.

Also things like performance, and scalability haven't really been put to the test.

### How can you help?
First step is to actually use the module. The more it gets used the easier it will be for us to find issues and fix them.

Additionally any insights on performance and code quality are particularly welcome, especially if you are very familiar 
with GraphQL and/or Search API (#graphql and #search Drupal community I'm looking at you!).
